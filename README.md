# Fixed-wing-drone-fly-controller

Our team at MakinaFleo is proud to present our work on developing an autonomous fixed-wing UAV. This project includes thirth versions of a flight controller based on PID control, enabling the UAV to automatically stabilize itself on both the pitch and roll axes.
Weâ€™ve tested our system successfully, achieving stable and responsive flight performance. This repository is open-source to support collaboration and innovation in UAV technology.
Stay tuned as we release test flight videos on our YouTube channel to showcase the system in action!
